# Parkinson's Disease Predictive Model

Luis Alba Molina - Data Analyst 2022

# What is it?

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes nerve cells (or neurons) in the area of the brain that controls movement to weaken and/or die.

10,000,000 Global estimate of people that have PD.

# Overview

The purpose of this project is to generate a predictive model that can be an auxiliary tool for the clinicians and medics for diagnosing PD without invasive procedures or even in early stages when symptoms may not be evident or noticeable.

Using Exploratory Data Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, Variance Inflation Factor and multiple classification models that use Machine Learning we can reach a reliable prediction for new patients.

# Libraries and Tools

* Oxford Parkinson's dataset
* Python
* Jupyter
* Scikit-learn
* Statsmodels
* Pandas
* Numpy
* XGBoost Classifier
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib

# Results

Random Forest Classifier delivers the best results with around 85 to 90% prediction accuracy.

Random Forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.

# Conclusion

With this predictive model and the appropiate medical equipment,
